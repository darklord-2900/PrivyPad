A simple Notes Management Application with features to store data provided by different users to keep their notes stored. 
iNotebook is made by following MERN Stack principles of Web Development.
The basic operations of this application are :
  1. Private and secure space for each user
  2. Users are able to Sign Up using their Name, Email, and can set a password which is securely stored in the database
     in encrypted format to ensure safety to the user's data.  
 
 To start this app on your local machine(windows)
 1. in the iNotebook folder run command in terminal -->> npm start  --> this will start the app on your local host at port 3000
 2. then open a paralell terminal and go to the backend folder and run command in terminal -->> nodemon .\index.js --> this will run the server side scripts
    and the backend will be live and now you can this app happily :-)
